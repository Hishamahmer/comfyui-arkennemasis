"""Image generation through a ChatGPT/Codex login — no API key.

Routes `gpt-image-2` through the ChatGPT Codex Responses API's ``image_generation``
tool, authenticated with the OAuth credentials `codex login` already wrote. Billed to
your ChatGPT plan instead of per image; the pay-per-image route to the same model is the
fal GPT Image 2 Edit node.

Multiple accounts: give each its own ``CODEX_HOME`` folder, log into each with the CLI,
and point ``codex_home`` at the one you want. Blank = ``~/.codex``.

Availability is account-dependent: not every ChatGPT plan can call the hosted image
tool. When it cannot, the backend answers with a specific 400 that we translate into a
readable error rather than a raw HTTP dump.
