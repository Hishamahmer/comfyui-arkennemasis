"""Text + vision through a ChatGPT/Codex login — no API key.

The counterpart to `ArkCodexImageGen`: same Responses endpoint, same OAuth credentials
`codex login` already wrote, same retry/throttle plumbing — but it returns TEXT instead
of pixels. Built for the storyboard/scene-planning step of a video pipeline, where one
call has to turn an idea into a structured JSON array of scenes.

Why this exists: it routes a GPT-5-class model through a ChatGPT plan, so a workflow
can plan AND render without an API key anywhere in it.

Model availability is account-dependent and undocumented — the backend is the Codex
CLI's, not a published API. `model` is a combo of what this machine's Codex CLI has
actually been observed using, and `model_override` takes a raw string for anything
newer than this file.
