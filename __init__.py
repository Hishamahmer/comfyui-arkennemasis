"""arkennemasis — ComfyUI nodes for many AI use cases, under one brand.

Menu layout:  arkennemasis/LLM  ·  /Image Gen  ·  /Utility  ·  /Video  ·  /Audio
              /Variation  ·  /Avatar

Currently bundled:
  * Replicate  — OpenAI GPT-5 LLM (text + vision) and gpt-image-2, via an API key.
  * Codex      — the same image model through the ChatGPT/Codex CLI login, no API key.
                 Requires a paid ChatGPT plan and `codex login` already run in a terminal.
  * Utility    — System Instructions, Shot Selector, Run Folder, Text File Save,
                 Subject Line, Codex Login Status, and the shared Image Gen Settings.
  * Video      — Scene List (the loop), Hailuo Scene, Caption Style and Video Assemble:
                 a scene plan in, one narrated and subtitled video out.
More providers/use cases (Ollama, Fal, Excalidraw, ...) drop in as sibling packages.

Each module is loaded independently, so a missing optional dependency only disables
that one module instead of breaking the whole pack.
