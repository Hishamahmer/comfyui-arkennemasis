"""Pin an image model's output shape to the shape of the image it is editing.

`aspect_ratio` on the Codex node is a dropdown of fixed ratios plus `auto`, and `auto`
sends **nothing**: no `size` on the tool and no aspect sentence in the prompt. For a
generate-from-nothing workflow that is fine. For an EDIT — a thumbnail, a portrait — it
means the one thing that must not change is the one thing nothing is asking for. The
result comes back reshaped and the whole preservation promise is broken by omission.

This node measures the actual image and emits a settings bundle naming its ratio, which
the image node reads in place of its own widget. So the shape follows the upload instead
of being guessed or hard-coded, and it is FIXED rather than `auto`.

**Why a settings bundle and not a wire into the dropdown**: ComfyUI rejects `STRING` ->
`COMBO` links. `ARK_IMAGE_SETTINGS` is the typed dict that exists precisely to get around
that, and every arkennemasis Image Gen node already has a `settings` socket that overrides
its own widgets. Nothing about the image node changes.

Chain a shared `ArkImageGenSettings` in through `base` to set quality and the rest in one
place; this node only ever replaces `aspect_ratio`.
