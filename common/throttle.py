"""Concurrency + retry helpers shared by every provider.

ComfyUI runs `async def` nodes **concurrently**, so several API nodes in one graph fire
their requests at the same moment. That is great for throughput and fatal for providers
with a small burst allowance - a low-credit or free-tier account can be held to a burst of
one request, so parallel calls reliably 429.

Three independent mitigations live here:

* :func:`serial_lock` — an asyncio lock so nodes sharing a key run one at a time.
* :func:`concurrency_gate` — the same idea with a dial instead of a hard 1.
* :func:`with_retry` — retries a call that never got a complete answer: a 429, a 5xx, or
  a connection that died mid-response. Honours ``Retry-After`` when the provider sends
  one. Anything else (a refusal, a bad request, an auth failure) propagates immediately —
  retrying those just burns time and money.

Why the transport cases matter: one 24-shot batch died at shot ~20 on
``httpx.RemoteProtocolError: peer closed connection without sending complete message body``
from the Codex backend. A node exception aborts the whole ComfyUI prompt, so a single
network blip threw away the rest of the run.
