"""One settings node driving many Image Gen nodes.

ComfyUI rejects a STRING link into a COMBO widget ("received_type(STRING) mismatch
input_type(COMBO)"), so a shared aspect_ratio / quality / ... cannot be wired straight
into the widgets. This node bundles them into a single typed value instead: wire its
one output into the ``settings`` socket of every Image Gen node and change them all in
one place.

Anything left on ``use node's own`` falls through to that node's own widget, so you can
share most settings and still override one shot locally.

``number_of_images`` is deliberately **not** shared. Multiplying it across every wired node
is rarely intended, and in a graph that names files deterministically the extra images all
land on the same filename and overwrite each other. Set it per node if you really want it.

The class key ``ArkImageGenSettings`` and its widget order are frozen: saved canvases
(hairstyle, thumbnail, furniture) carry them. ``api_token`` stays for that reason only -
no current node reads it.
