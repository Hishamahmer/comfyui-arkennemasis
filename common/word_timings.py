"""When each word is actually spoken, measured from the audio instead of guessed.

The moving caption styles — `highlight`, `karaoke`, `underline`, `word_by_word` — have to
know when each word lands. Until now that was an ESTIMATE: `ass_captions.estimate_words`
shares a cue's span between its words in proportion to their letter count, plus a small
bonus after punctuation. Its own docstring is honest about the limit — *"NOT
frame-accurate, and it drifts"* — and drift is exactly what a viewer notices, because the
highlight sitting one word behind the voice is more distracting than no highlight at all.

The estimate is wrong in a specific, unavoidable way: letter count is not duration.
"through" is seven letters and one beat; "AI" is two letters and two syllables spoken
slowly. Any weighting scheme is guessing at something the audio already knows.

So this node asks the audio. Whisper returns per-word timestamps, and those replace the
estimate entirely — both the word marks AND the cue boundaries, which were previously
shared out by the same proportional guess.

Two settings are load-bearing, both learned the hard way on this machine:

  * **`large-v3`, not `turbo`.** Turbo is faster and its timestamps are looser.
  * **Never pass `chunk_length_s`.** It switches transformers to the chunked algorithm,
    whose timestamps go astray at every chunk seam. Omitting it uses Whisper's sequential
    long-form decoding, which carries context across the whole clip.

A previous one-off measured this at **95.2%** — 300 of 315 sampled moments highlighting
the word actually being spoken. The estimate is nowhere near that.

**Measured once per clip.** The result is kept on disk under the audio itself (samples, rate,
model, language), so pressing Run again on the same voice-over reads it back instead of
loading Whisper and paying for the same answer twice.

**It transcribes rather than force-aligns**, and for this pipeline that is the right way
round: the narration is a text-to-speech reading of a script we wrote, so the words come
back the same, and on the rare occasion the voice says something slightly different the
captions then match what was SAID rather than what was planned.
