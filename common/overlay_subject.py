"""Stand a cut-out subject in front of a background, at a chosen size and position.

This is the piece a hosted avatar service does for you and never lets you see. HeyGen's
request body carries `character.scale`, `character.offset` and `background.fit`, and those
three numbers are the whole composition: how big the presenter is, where they stand, and
how the backdrop fills the frame. Doing it locally means owning them.

    background ──┐
                 ├─► canvas (W x H) ──► subject scaled to `subject_scale` of the height,
    subject ─────┤                      placed by `anchor` + `offset_x/offset_y`
    mask    ─────┘

**The subject is cropped to its mask before it is scaled**, and that is the difference
between this working and not. A generated talking-head frame is a whole picture with a
person somewhere inside it; scaling that by 0.7 scales the empty room too, and the
presenter ends up small and off to one side. Cropping to the mask first makes
`subject_scale` mean what it says: the fraction of the canvas height the PERSON occupies.

**The crop box is the union across every frame by default.** Per-frame boxes track the
subject more tightly, and they also breathe — the box grows a pixel when a hand lifts, so
the whole person shifts and scales slightly on that frame. Over a clip that reads as a
wobble. One box for the whole clip is a locked-off camera; that is what a presenter shot
should be.

**Frames are composited in chunks.** A minute of 720x1280 at 25 fps is 1500 frames, and
float32 RGB at that size is 11 MB each — 16 GB for one copy of the batch. The output is
preallocated once and filled a slice at a time, so peak memory is the output plus one
chunk rather than the output plus several full-size intermediates.

Nothing here is avatar-specific: a foreground, its mask, and a backdrop.
